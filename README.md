Project: Secure Remote Access VPN with pfSense & OpenVPN
Objective:
To design, deploy, and verify a secure remote access VPN solution for a simulated corporate network. This project demonstrates core competencies in network administration, security protocols, and troubleshooting methodologies. A remote user will securely connect to the "corporate" network over a simulated internet connection, gaining access to internal resources as if they were physically in the office.

Technologies Used:

Virtualization: Oracle VirtualBox

Network Simulation: GNS3

Firewall/VPN Gateway: pfSense (Open-source firewall distribution)

VPN Protocol: OpenVPN

Network Analysis: Wireshark
